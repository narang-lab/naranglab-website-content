Topics in our group unify and push new directions in ab initio materials theory and transport methods, excited-state nanophotonics, ultrafast and nonequilibrium dynamics, computational condensed matter physics, topological materials science, and defects in quantum materials.

We also have an active and growing effort in quantum information science, spanning quantum algorithms for quantum computation as well as simulation and emulation directions in quantum network science.
