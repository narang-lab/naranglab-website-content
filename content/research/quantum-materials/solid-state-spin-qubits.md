We have an active effort on how to model quantum defects in solids ("artificial atoms in solids") such that we can guide the development of next-generation scalable quantum systems. Through ab initio calculations and new theoretical methods, we are working towards artificial atoms with desired quantum properties that advance artificial quantum coherent systems. 

Our group currently has an Army Research Office funded MURI (Ab Initio Solid-State Quantum Materials) on design of new quantum emitters in 2D materials and a recently awarded (2021) Office of Naval Research MURI on "Topological Spin Qubits Based on Graphene Nanoribbons". With colleagues at Oakridge National Lab (ORNL) we are supported by the Department of Energy Basic Energy Sciences QIS grant on "Atom-by-atom design and fabrication of new quantum technologies". We also received an NSF CAREER Award for "First Principles Design of Error-Corrected Solid-State Quantum Repeaters" in 2020. Our group is part of the Center for Quantum Networks (NSF ERC, awarded in 2020) and an NSF QuIC TAQS program on "Deterministically Placed Nuclear Spin Quantum Memories for Entanglement Distribution".

This is a rapidly expanding field. Here's a Perspective by Dr. John Philbin and Prof. Prineha Narang on "Computational Materials Insights Into Solid-State Multiqubit Systems" published in PRX Quantum in September 2021. From the Popular Summary, "In this Perspective, we break down the challenges associated with modeling quantum phenomena in multiqubit solid-state material systems, leveraging advances in high-performance supercomputing and algorithms in computational physics." Further "We provide a forward-looking view on how recent advances at the intersection of materials physics and quantum information can accelerate the discovery and development of new and improved solid-state qubits. In particular, we present new computational approaches for performing large-scale simulations of multiqubit systems using ab initio methods, quantum embedding methods, and open quantum system techniques."
