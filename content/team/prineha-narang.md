Prineha Narang is an Assistant Professor at the John A. Paulson School of Engineering and Applied Sciences at Harvard University. Prior to joining the faculty, Prineha came to Harvard as a Ziff Environmental Fellow at the Harvard University Center for the Environment. She was also a Research Scholar in Condensed Matter Theory at the MIT Dept. of Physics, working on new theoretical methods to describe quantum interactions.

Prineha’s work has been recognized by many awards and special designations, including the Mildred Dresselhaus Prize,  a Friedrich Wilhelm Bessel Research Award (Bessel Prize) from the Alexander von Humboldt Foundation, a Max Planck Sabbatical Award from the Max Planck Society, and the IUPAP Young Scientist Prize in Computational Physics in 2021,  a National Science Foundation CAREER Award in 2020, being named a Moore Inventor Fellow by the Gordon and Betty Moore Foundation for innovations in quantum science and technology, CIFAR Azrieli Global Scholar by the Canadian Institute for Advanced Research, a Top Innovator by MIT Tech Review (MIT TR35), and a Young Scientist by the World Economic Forum in 2018. In 2017, she was named by Forbes Magazine on their “30under30” list for her work in atom-by-atom quantum engineering. Prineha designs materials at the smallest scale, using single atoms, to enable the leap to quantum technologies.

Prineha received her Sc.B. in Materials Science from Drexel University and an M.S. and Ph.D. in Applied Physics from the California Institute of Technology (Caltech), as a National Science Foundation Graduate Fellow and Resnick Sustainability Institute Fellow, where her work focused on understanding light-matter interactions in areas ranging from quantum plasmonics to nitride optoelectronics.  Outside of science, she is an avid triathlete and runner. Time spent outdoors is important to her and here's a Faculty Spotlight highlighting how she spends time outside the lab and an article by the Moore Foundation on "Beyond the Lab".
