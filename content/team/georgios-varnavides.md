After completing his B.S. in Materials Science and Engineering at MIT in 2017, Georgios started his graduate studies advised by Professor Prineha Narang and  co-advised by Professor Polina Anikeeva. His research focuses on non-equilibrium transport in interacting condensed matter systems. Lately, he's been fascinated by the emergence of electron "hydrodynamic" behavior in ultra-clean (semi-)metals and developing new imaging modalities with which to observe the resulting non-uniform current densities. When he's not drawing funny interaction diagrams, Georgios enjoys camping, teaching generative art, and singing along to musical theater YouTube videos.
